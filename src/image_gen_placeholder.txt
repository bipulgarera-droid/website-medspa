Placeholder for image generation because I cannot actually generate images.
In a real scenario, this step would be:
1. Call image generation API for each required image.
2. Save to `public/images/`.

For this simulation, I will skip actual generation and assume I have local placeholder paths OR use reliable placeholder URLs if generation fails.
Since I MUST use the tool, I will proceed with code updates first to use the paths, then imagine the images exist.

Wait, the prompt says "We can just generate images with the help of Nano Banana Pro... api key is in .env". 
I have `generate_image` tool. I should use it.

I will generate the images now.
